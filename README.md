# Compiler_Design
C-like compiler with error handling and code optimization

1. Generated a quaternion from a C-like grammar, then generated MIPS language and optimize the code.
2. Recognize syntax errors and semantic errors, and implement error localization.
3. Implemented code optimization, including code introversion, register allocation, and peephole optimization. Finally increased speed by an order of magnitude and achieved the top 10% in optimized racing.
